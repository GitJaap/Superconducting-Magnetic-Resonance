Superconducting-Magnetic-Resonance
==================================
Qtlab installation with a folder called project for project-specific files.
project/main/main is run when QtLab is started.
Qtlab is modified slightly so it also works in eclipse(by setting the right current directories).
For eclipse: run source/qtlab_shell.py
